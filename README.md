# expert umbrella / [Project shiorium](https://shiorium.pythonanywhere.com/)

Shiorium projects is an open source website application for writing fanfiction story which inspired by [fanfiction.net](https://www.fanfiction.net/) and [ao3](https://archiveofourown.org) but unlike the two that contain broad kind of fandom, this site only focusing in one instead that is [Shiori Novella](https://twitter.com/shiorinovella), but why?

## Why i made this site?

[Shiori Novella](https://twitter.com/shiorinovella) is a vtuber who have theme that related to books or story, and also create a twitter tag for fanfiction: [#shiorinstories](https://twitter.com/hashtag/shiorinstories?src=hashtag_click). Actually there are a website that help someone to get the story without scrolling through twitter it is [novelit.es](https://novelit.es/) this nice yet simple website will fetch the posts from twitter with related tag and save it to database before being served to visitor. Because of that website i got an idea, "How about the story is in form of text instead image? and how about if i made 'true' archiving system on it?" and thus i made this website. So what you can do at [Project shiorium](https://shiorium.pythonanywhere.com/)?

## Features and major difference

The general purpose of [Project shiorium](https://shiorium.pythonanywhere.com/) pretty much same as [fanfiction.net](https://www.fanfiction.net/) and [ao3](https://archiveofourown.org) that is: **To provide a place for the fans a place to share their creativity**, but of course there are some major difference from the others, such as:

1. Mobile friendly: Thanks to [pico.css](https://v2.picocss.com/docs) i able to create a mobile friendly interface with minimal effort. I found that both [fanfiction.net](https://www.fanfiction.net/) and [ao3](https://archiveofourown.org) does not quite mobile freindly, i don't know wether that's their design choice or they just don't update the design

2. Easy to use: Comparing with  [fanfiction.net](https://www.fanfiction.net/),[Project shiorium](https://shiorium.pythonanywhere.com/) have more simpler creating process and more intuitive(I don't know about [ao3](https://archiveofourown.org)  yet)

3. Edit history system: Do you find your current edit is worst than your previous? No worries, you can revert back to any edits you find suitable

4. Simpler tagging system: Because [Project shiorium](https://shiorium.pythonanywhere.com/) is dedicated only one fandom, it has simpler tagging system to manage and grouping stories

5. Open source: Yup, [Project shiorium](https://shiorium.pythonanywhere.com/) is open sourced under MIT license, you can contribute in developing process to make it a better application 

6. Use Django framework: This site were made using django and python, so yeah, in terms of security it already handled by django

7. True archive: Unlike post in twitter [Project shiorium](https://shiorium.pythonanywhere.com/) this website could be proper place to save your work. I mean, do twitter supposed to be platform for this thing? 

Altough there are some pros compared to [fanfiction.net](https://www.fanfiction.net/) and [ao3](https://archiveofourown.org), [Project shiorium](https://shiorium.pythonanywhere.com/) still lack something like: the site doens't have file managing system. It's an hobby project you know, and i don't have budget to buy hosting that have large file storage, so yeah, things like cover image and profile picture are use url to work(for profile picture i use gravatar), but i'm sure that doesn't mean [Project shiorium](https://shiorium.pythonanywhere.com/) is unusable. But if you want you can help in development process, here's how:

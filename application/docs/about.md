## So what is this site?
This site is one of my side projects that inspired by [novelit.es](https://novelit.es) which of course inspired by vtuber [Shiori Novella](https://twitter.com/shiorinovella)(Who is also my favorite) and her [#ShiorinStories](https://twitter.com/hashtag/ShiorinStories?src=hashtag_click), allowing her fans to post fanfiction about her and/or her friends on tweeter. 
But, i see that majority(all maybe?) of the posts is in form not as writing(like in blog or website) but as a screenshot, and then i was thinking, why just not put it in a website or blog which is more convinient or maybe write it in website that have main functionalty to write fanfiction, like [fanfiction.net](https://www.fanfiction.net/)(it's literally in the name). I've try the [fanfiction.net](https://www.fanfiction.net/) tho, and for me it's hard to navigate for writing you only able to write and publish fanfiction on pc or laptop. But then i came up with an idea, why don't i develop a website that modeled after [fanfiction.net](https://www.fanfiction.net/) but for fanfiction about Shiori in particular and other hololive talent in general? isn't that nice?

## How do you build this site?
This website are developed using [Django framework](https://www.djangoproject.com) because how easy it was as framework, but unfortunately i unable to add feature like file upload because i only can use free tier hosting from [pythonanywhere.com](https://www.pythonanywhere.com) with limited storage. I know it's bit contradicts that i use django when the problem is the storage, but the thing is even if I use small framework like [flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/) the storage is still not enough and i need to build many things from scratch, and i also think that flask were not suitable for this kind of website. How about PHP or maybe Node js? well, i know the basic of those language, but i mostly use python and i haven't find(yet) hosting service for other language that's free and as nice as [pythonanywhere.com](https://www.pythonanywhere.com).

## So what's the features of this site?
Well, other than managing stories you've write, you also could create a group and grouping the stories you've made. It's not mandatory to put a stories in a group and make it a standalone fiction. Of coure there will be more feature to be added, but i think that was the basic of this site.  
But of course there should be more to be added, such as: 

1. Follow a group
2. Email verification(well, i need to upgrade my smtp provider)
3. Social account
4. File manager
5. User notification

And would many more, since this site would be an open source project anyone can contribute what to be added or just make things better for the website.

Maybe if you kinda don't trust this site, you can use just random email(random but still a valid email) for creating new account, but if you forget the password you're unable to recover it using email. I have no intention to extract or even doxx someone online, it's useless. Yes, you can see the source code on github and see what's inside and check is there any something malicious.

Well, i know this is not a piece of drawing or even a game like [holocure](https://kay-yu.itch.io/holocure), it's just a simple website, but i feel it's also special like other fanart. Yeah because the art in fanart is not just drawing or painting, but an art.
